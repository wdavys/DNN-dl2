# DNN-dl2
This project is intented to thoroughly study Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) generations' (gray images) quality on both MNIST and BinaryAlpha Digits with respect to their hyperparameters and architecture designs. Finally, we use the result of that study to properly train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify MNIST images.
